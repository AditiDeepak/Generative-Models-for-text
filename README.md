# Generative-Models-for-text
Built a generative model using LSTM Neural Network to mimic Bertrand Russel's writing style. Also generated thousand new characters using the trained model.

The dataset was obtained from - http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/355

Utilized the following four books for training the LSTM model - 
1. The Problems of Philosophy
2. The Analysis of Mind
3. Mysticism and Logic and Other Essays
4. Our Knowledge of the External World as a Field for Scientific Method in Philosophy

The pre-processing steps were- 
1. To remove the unwanted data from the text files
2. To create a large corpus of Russel's writings

The next step is to train the LSTM network and finally to generate thousand characters using the best weights of the model.
